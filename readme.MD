  - 'CPM code' contains all code and data related to model memory and arousal-predictive network.
  - 'data' contains all data used for all modeling and analysis
  - 'final_figs' contains all figures in the paper and supplement
  - 'plots' contains all intermediate plots directly generated by the code
  - 'results' contains all generated results/itermedium data generated from the analysis code
  
# file descriptions:
  - 'behavioral_data_analysis' R code for analysis behavior data
  - 'network anatomical heatmap' python code for plotting distribution of edges in the network, Figure 2D-E,Figure S2, S4
  - 'network anatomical overlap' python code for analysis under section "Cortisol changes which edges are involved in predictive networks "; result in Table S2-4; generate data for plot Figure3 and Figure S3
  - 'overlap_vis' R code to generate plot for overlapping egeds between networks (Figure 3 and Figure S3)
  - 'plot_model_performance' R code for plotting prediction performance of the networks. Figure 2C; 5
  - 'other data curation.ipynb' analysis demographic data and trials used in each prediction model

# file/varible name mapping
    - RecogAcc_coded == Memory
    - Arous_All == Arousal
    - tool == Neutral Run
    - alc == Emotional Run
    - pos == postive network (edges in the network [positively] correlated with behavior)
    - neg == negative network (edges in the network negatively correlated with behavior)
    - e.g. "n26_RecogAcc_coded_byTrial_cortisol_alc_htBPfiltered_p0.01_neg.txt" means negative network predicting memory under cortisol in emotional run
