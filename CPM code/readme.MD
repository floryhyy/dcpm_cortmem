# All code and data related to model memory and arousal-predictive network.
 - 'run_cpm.m' is the main file that runs all code for building the model and obtain the network
 - 'permutation*.m' files are run on clusters to obtain null distribution of the network predictions
 - 'compute acc stats.ipynb' contains code to calculate accuracy measurement for networks predicting memory.

 ## In result
  - 'permutation' folder contains all null distribution data
  - 'network_edges' contains edges in the network
  - "*updated.csvs" files contains data in Table S1, S5, S6
